## Detailed Test Results

### Test 1-2: Environment Setup
- **Challenge:** Python 3.13 and Java version incompatibilities
- **Solution:** Installed Python 3.11 and Java 17 for PySpark compatibility
- **Outcome:** Spark session initialized successfully

### Test 3-4: Data Ingestion
- **Input:** sales.csv (structured), reviews.json (unstructured)
- **Result:** Both datasets loaded without errors
- **Validation:** Schema inferred correctly for both files

### Test 5-6: Data Processing & Output
- **Challenge:** Windows required Hadoop native libraries (winutils.exe)
- **Solution:** Downloaded and configured Hadoop 3.3.5 binaries with HADOOP_HOME environment variable
- **Result:** Parquet files generated successfully in output directory

### Test 7-9: Analytics Validation
- **Top Products Analysis:** Successfully identified products 101 and 102 as bestsellers (3 sales each)
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Extracted and counted sentiment keywords from customer reviews
  - Positive: "good" (8), "love" (3)
  - Negative: "bad" (5), "slow" (4)
- **Performance:** Complete pipeline execution time: ~30 seconds
